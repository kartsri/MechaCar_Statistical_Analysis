The current manufacturing data indicates that Lot 1 and Lot 2 meet the design specification, as their variance of the suspension coils is below 100 psi. However, Lot 3 is out of compliance of this design specification, as it has a variance of 170.286 psi. 

Overall, the total for all lots combined meets the design specification of having under 100 psi for the Variance.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

To compare the MechaCar against industry competition, I propose a statistcal study  that will test the Variance of suspension coil pressure, measured in Pressure per Square Inch. The null hypothesis is that all lots are within compliance of the 100 psi variance rule reference above.
